Section 2: Needy Modules
Needy modules cannot be disarmed, but pose a recurrent hazard.
Needy modules can be identified as a module with a small 2â€‘digit timer in the top center. Interacting with the bomb may cause them to become activated. Once activated, these needy modules must be tended to regularly before their timer expires in order to prevent a strike.
Stay observant: needy modules may reactivate at any time.
