On the Subject of Knobs
Needlessly complicated and endlessly needy. Imagine if such expertise were used to make something other than diabolical puzzles.
The knob can be turned to one of four different positions.
The knob must be in the correct position when this module's timer hits zero.
The correct position can be determined by the on/off configuration of the twelve LEDs.
Knob positions are relative to the "UP" label, which may have rotated.
