On the Subject of Complicated Wires
These wires aren't like the others. Some have stripes! That makes them completely different. The good news is that we've found a concise set of instructions on what to do about it! Maybe too concise...
Look at each wire: there is an LED above the wire and a space for a "★" symbol below the wire.
For each wire/LED/symbol combination, use the Venn diagram below to decide whether or not to cut the wire.
Each wire may be striped with multiple colors.
