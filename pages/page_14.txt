 Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes v. 1 Wire Sequences
On the Subject of Wire Sequences
It's hard to say how this mechanism works. The engineering is pretty impressive, but there must have been an easier way to manage nine wires.
Within this module there are several panels with wires on them, but only one panel is visible at a time. Switch to the next panel by using the down button and the previous panel by using the up button.
Do not switch to the next panel until you are sure that you have cut all necessary wires on the current panel.
Cut the wires as directed by the following table. Wire occurrences are cumulative over all panels within the module.
